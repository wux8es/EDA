        "3) There are unique ways that data sets need to be cleaned. For each case, it is easy to define what are variables and observations. For the whole data set, it is more difficult.\n",
        "4) Values are numbers or strings organized into a data set. Each value belongs to a variable and an observation. A variable contains all measurments of one attribute (like the heights of multiple people). An observation is all values measured on one unit (for example, one person).\n",
        "5) Each variable forms a column, each observation forms a row, and each type of observational unit forms a table.\n",
        "6) Column headers are values, not variable names. Multiple variables are stored in one column. Variables are stored in both rows and columns. Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table. A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables. The columns need to be turned into rows. Melting means to reformat the data set turning the columns into rows.\n",
        "7) Because table 11 has a column for each day of the month, and is not easily comprehensible. Also, the observations are columns and should be rows. Table 12(a) is molten because the columns and rows are switched appropriately. Table 12(b) is tidy because it includes variables instead of names in the third column.\n",

How should future large scale surveys be adjusted to best reflect the diversity of the population? Could some of the Census' good practices be adopted more widely to gather richer and more useful data?\n",

        "5. When it comes to cleaning data, what concerns do you have about protected characteristics like sex, gender, sexual identity, or race? What challenges can you imagine arising when there are missing values? What good or bad practices might people adopt, and why?\n",
        "6. Suppose someone invented an algorithm to impute values for protected characteristics like race, gender, sex, or sexuality. What kinds of concerns would you have?"

        "1. The census asked through 5 categories (Black, White, American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander). Respondents can also designate themselves under the “Some Other Race” category and can report more than one race.\n",
        "2. We gather these data to minimize discrimination and ensure fair treatment. These data can encourage legislation and action for a society with equal opportunity. The effectiveness and fairness of the legislation is dependent on the quality of the data.\n",
        "3. It is good we are collecting data on race, but there should be more more options when designating yourself as a specific race instead of just “Some Other Race. Within practical reason, I believe the more specific the census gets about race/gender data, the better.\n",
        "4. According to the census website, the census only asks about current sex and does not ask about gender or sexual orientation. It may be helpful to also ask about gender/sexual orientation to gather data on gender/sexual orientation trends and associations in the U.S.\n",
        "5. There may be many observations, making it it difficult to clean and organize the data. Moral judgements must be made to handle missing values. Data scientists must decide what can truly be designated as missing values, and what must be kept. Data scientists may become careless about lumping everyone’s gender and sexual characteristics together.\n",
        "6. My main concern with an algorithm like this is its purpose. Why would someone need to impute such characteristics? What are they used for? Collecting such data can have grave consequences as we have seen throughout history.\n"
